 * routes it bakes in (the RSS and Substack feeds) hold no content, and robots.txt and
 * the sitemap index name the build's host rather than this deployment's. An image
 * Coolify builds bakes in every article and volume as the database held them during
 * the build, which edits saved since never reach.
 * `dockerfiles/scripts/start.sh` calls this once the server is up, for both, and the
 * Worker's deploy workflow once it has deployed.

 * Authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer <PAYLOAD_SECRET>`, which the
